# n8n Workflows Templates

This repo contains n8n workflow templates I created to solve real-world automation tasks—either for personal or freelance projects.

## Structure

Each folder includes:

- `workflow.json` — ready to import into your n8n instance  
- `README.md` — setup steps, usage, and credentials (if needed)

## How to Use

1. Pick a folder  
2. Import the JSON file into your n8n  
3. Follow the README for setup
